The search history shows the last 3 searches and you can go to a random URL from a list I have stored in an array. In development everything worked fine up until deploying on Vercel so I had to make use of Browserless. The project also uses Puppeteer and I hope to implement the option to filter small images and the ability to download all or a selection of images.',
